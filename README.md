# ga4gh-xena-controller

This software presents methods in the GA4GH namespace that gather data from
[UCSC Xena](http://xena.ucsc.edu) queries.

It can be combined with the [ga4gh-node-gateway](https://github.com/david4096/ga4gh-node-gateway) to present a server that responds to ga4gh requests.

It depends on babel for ES6 templating of Xena queries.
